# Sentiment-Analysis
This Python script scrapes British Airways , cleans the text by removing URLs, special characters, and stopwords, and applies lemmatization. It generates a word cloud of frequent terms and performs sentiment analysis with TextBlob to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, visualizing the sentiment distribution with a Seaborn bar chart.
